📡 RF Technology-Based Ambulance Light Control System (Arduino Project)

# 🧾 Abstract
- Developed a wireless system to control ambulance emergency lights using RF (Radio Frequency) modules.

- Uses Arduino microcontrollers for signal processing and response.

- Enhances reliability, reduces wiring, and enables remote activation of lights/sirens.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Eliminate wired system limitations with RF wireless control.

- Build a transmitter unit with push-buttons to send ON/OFF signals.

- Develop a receiver unit to decode and respond to signals.

- Ensure low-cost, responsive, and scalable design.

## 🛠️ Components Required

1) Component	                Description

2) Arduino Uno/Nano (×2)	    Microcontroller boards

3) RF Transmitter + Receiver	433 MHz modules

4) Push Buttons (×2)	        User input switches

5) LEDs (×4)	                Simulated ambulance lights

6) Resistors (220Ω, ×4)      	For LED protection

7) Breadboard + Jumper Wires	Prototyping and wiring

8) Power Supply (USB/9V)	    Arduino and RF module power source


## ⚙️ Working Principle

**Transmitter**:

Button press sends signal via 433 MHz RF module.

Arduino encodes and transmits ON/OFF commands.

**Receiver**:

RF module receives signal and passes it to Arduino.

Arduino activates or deactivates LEDs (emergency lights).
